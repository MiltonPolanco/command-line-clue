## Notes
*Use this space to record your findings and deductions...*
I was in the kitchen of the school and seems like there is where the crime happened.
The baker was in the shops with the brass candlestick.
The shoppkeeper was in the houses.

Location of the crime is still unknown - the room must have been empty when it happened...
